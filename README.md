## What is Analog Clock?
Analog clock is the simple clock app made with Python using Pygame framework which represents current time.

## Description
In this project I used math library which allowed me to calculate the correct angles using mathematical functions of pi, cos and sin. 
Also, datetime was used to represent the current time accurately. 
Pygame allowed me to pack everything into a single executable and to set a cute background for my clock.
